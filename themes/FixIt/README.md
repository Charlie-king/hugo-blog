> **FixIt** is a **clean**, **elegant** but **advanced** blog theme for [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/).

It is based on the original [LoveIt Theme](https://github.com/dillonzq/LoveIt), [LeaveIt Theme](https://github.com/liuzc/LeaveIt) and [KeepIt Theme](https://github.com/Fastbyte01/KeepIt).

[LoveIt Theme](https://github.com/dillonzq/LoveIt) is a awesome hugo theme for us, I'm sorry that it's repository has been out of maintenance for a long time, so I rebuilt a new fork named FixIt so that I can better **Fix It** and make it more user-friendly.

The FixIt theme inherits the excellent functions of these themes, and adds new functions and optimizations on this basis. Please read [Why Choose FixIt](#why-choose-fixit) to learn more.

## [Getting started](https://fixit.lruihao.cn/categories/documentation/)

Head to this [documentation page](https://fixit.lruihao.cn/theme-documentation-basics/) for a complete guidence to get started with the FixIt theme.

Or run [Documentation Site](https://fixit.lruihao.cn) locally:

```bash
hugo server --source=exampleSite
```

Of course, you can also read the [FixIt wiki](https://github.com/Lruihao/FixIt/wiki) directly.

## Migrate and Update

If you are currently using the LoveIt theme (or some other themes), it is very easy to migrate to FixIt.

You can add this repo as a submodule of your site directory.

```bash
git submodule add https://github.com/Lruihao/FixIt.git themes/FixIt
```

And later you can update the submodule in your site directory to the latest commit using this command:

```bash
git submodule update --remote --merge
```

Or use shell command `fixit_checker.sh` to update and commit in the theme directory.

```bash
sh fixit_checker.sh
```

Next, go to the `config.toml` and change the default theme to `FixIt`.

```diff
- theme = "LoveIt"
+ theme = "FixIt"
```

Now the migration is finished and everything is ready ðŸŽ‰
